# Contributing to Libredesk

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **All PRs must align with the project’s scope, goals, and technical direction.**
- **Large or non-trivial PRs should be discussed first via an issue.**
- Please keep PRs focused on a single concern where possible.
  
## Process

- **Propose first**  
  Open an issue describing what you want to build, why it fits Libredesk,
  and the high-level implementation approach.

- **Keep PRs small**  
  Smaller, well-scoped PRs are easier to review and test.
  Bundling multiple features into a single PR is discouraged.

Thanks for helping keep Libredesk focused and maintainable.
